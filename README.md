# Art Garfunkel's reading list

Art Garfunkel has kept a [meticulous list](http://www.artgarfunkel.com/library.html) of every book he's read since June 1968.

## Assumptions (and citations)

I assume:
1. Art has read every day since 01 June, 1968. ("Since the 1960's, Art Garfunkel has been a voracious reader.")
1. Every book Art has read appears on the list ("We are pleased to present a listing of every book Art has read since 1968.")
1. Art reads every day.
1. Art reads at a constant speed.

These assumptions allow us to calculate which page of which book Art was on at any date between 01 June 1968 and November 2016 (the last date on the list).

## Did Art Garfunkel stop reading after November 2016?

Who knows? Lots of things changed in November 2016. Maybe he didn't take any joy in reading anymore. Maybe he decided 48 years of list-keeping was enough.
